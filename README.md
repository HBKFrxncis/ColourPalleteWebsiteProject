# ColourPalleteWebsiteProject
This is an Colour Pallete Website I built for My End of First Year University Assignment Submission. 
My project caters specifically to graphic designers, artists, and individuals alike, offering a
solution that addresses the common struggles with originality and creativity. While it`s
tailored for professionals in the creative field, it's also accessible and beneficial for anyone
seeking inspiration.
The aim of my website is to alleviate the burden of visualizing colors and gradients,
empowering users to overcome the initial hurdles in their creative process. Rather than
grappling with the complexities of a traditional color wheel, users can explore a curated
selection of colors, shades, gradients, and palettes. This curated list serves as a
springboard for users embarking on various design tasks, whether it's web design, app
development, poster creation, business branding, or artistic endeavors.
By presenting a diverse array of options in an easily digestible format, my website enables
users to quickly find the perfect color scheme or gradient for their project. Additionally, it
simplifies the process further by providing Hex Color Codes for each selection, ensuring
users can effortlessly replicate their desired shades and combinations without frustration
or guesswork.
